          <p>
            Software Engineer with a wide range of experience in the tech
            industry. Combined I have over 5 years of experience working in IT
            and have recently transitioned to the Software Engineering side of
            tech to further my knowledge in a field that interests me. I am
            extremely passionate about technology and enjoy staying as
            up-to-date as possible. I would describe myself as extremely
            self-motivated and an enthusiastic team player. I spent two years
            pursuing a college degree in Computer Science. My goal is to
            continue my higher education in the near future. Currently, I am
            attending the Flatiron Schools coding boot camp to further my
            education and jumpstart a new career in the technology industry.

            Originally from Michigan, I currently live in the beautiful state of
            Colorado with my partner who is currently attending Veterinary
            school. We have two dogs, a 4 year Heeler named Bindi, and a 5 year
            old golden retriever named Sully. Some of my hobbies include hiking,
            traveling, adventuring with our dogs, the occasional video game, and
            working on my projects
