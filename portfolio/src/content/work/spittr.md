Splittr is a user-friendly expense management application built using Next.js, Typescript, Python, Flask, SQLite3 DB, and TailwindCSS. With Splittr, users can efficiently manage expenses after a night out with friends. The app allows users to sign up, login, and logout with ease. Additionally, users can create bills, split bills into individual items, and assign the items to the relevant users who need to pay for them. Splittr makes it easy for users to keep track of their expenses, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.
