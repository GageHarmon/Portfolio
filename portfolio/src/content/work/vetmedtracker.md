This is a front-end React application built using JavaScript that utilizes a local JSON file for data storage. The application is designed to display and manage a list of dogs and their medical treatment doses. The application includes three main components: HomePage, DosePage, and NotesPage, which can be accessed via the navigation bar at the top of the screen. The list of dogs is available on both the NotesPage and DosePage, and there is a search bar to allow users to easily select a specific dog and open the relevant forms. With this application, users can efficiently manage the medical treatment doses of their dogs and keep detailed notes on their health. The user-friendly interface and simple navigation make it easy to use for anyone.
